                        <p>Each year millions of people attempt to predict the results of March Madness, which is the end year tournament for college basketball. No one has ever come close to predicting all 63 games of the tournament. In fact in most years there are no perfect brackets after just the first round. Never the less I decided to try and create a model that would help me predict the outcomes of each game.</p>

                        <p> The model is a binary logistic regression model that would predict whether or not the higher seeded team would beat the lower seeded team.
                            The model was trained over a number of randomly selected regular season games from this last year and then tested over a smaller sample of games to prevent over fitting.

                            In the graph above (figure 1) if the points are on the right side of the diagonal line that means I gave the favorite a higher chance than the average bracket [we will use <a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2021/en/nationalBracket">ESPN's people's bracket</a> or ESPN's bracket as the average bracket, and this bracket was made by taking each entry from ESPN's Men's Tournament Challenge and counting each entry as a vote]. 70% of the upsets were located to the left of the diagonal line, with me correctly picking 30% of them. However ESPN's bracket correctly picked two more games than my model. With my biggest misses being Drake vs USC and Oral Roberts vs Ohio State.
                            Oral Roberts vs Ohio State was an usually hard game to pick since less than <a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2021/en/whopickedwhom">5%</a>
                            of people correctly picked the outcome of the game. Historically the 15 seed <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2021-03-19/history-2-seeds-vs-15-seeds-march-madness"> has an all time record of 9-135 vs 2 seeds or a 6.25% winning percentage</a> making this upset one of the biggest in the last 5 years.

                            As you can see in the bar chart race above (figure 2) I had a total of 7 brackets that correctly predicted more games than ESPN's bracket. However I had more than 7 brackets so to see a full picture of how all my brackets performed I created a histogram for the percentiles of brackets in <a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2021/en/leaderboard">ESPN's leaderboard</a> which is show below (figure 3).
                            In this figure my median bracket fell below the 50th percentile but the average bracket (ESPN's) fell within one standard deviation of the mean, so the average bracket is not statistically significantly better or worse than my brackets/model in general. Not to mention I had a bracket that is at the 50th percentile but picked less games correctly than my average bracket.
                            This is because, picking games in the later rounds correctly is worth more points, for example correctly picking the championship game is equal to 320 points which is the same amount as correctly picking the whole first round, despite picking 31 less games. So because of this to maximize a bracket's points it is important to pick the correct champion....

                            This year there were only 3 teams that had more than 10% of all brackets picking them to win it all, Gonzaga, Illinois, and Baylor [figure 4]. It just so happen that of those 3 teams the only team I did not pick once to win it all ending up being the champion (Baylor). Of the other two teams with more than a 10% chance, one of them went to the finals and lost (Gonzaga) and the other disappointed and lost in the second round (Illinois).
                            Both of these team were picked to win it all more frequently than Baylor within Gonzaga being predicted to win it all in over a third of all brackets. Between the other teams that I thought had a chance to win it all, they both made it past the first weekend (the first 2 rounds) but lost in the elite eight (Michigan) and final four (Houston).
                            Overall of all the favorites the team that failed to live up to expectations the most would have to be Illinois since 15% of ESPN brackets and 36% of my brackets chose them as champions but they failed to survive the first weekend.

                        Due to the large number of upsets and bigger upsets, this year's average seed at the end of the first round, second round, and Sweet Sixteen would be considered an outlier of the last few years since the numbers would not fall within

                        Specifically UCLA an 11 seed who barely made the tournament going all the way to the final four.
                        To further the chaos, the 15 seed Oral Roberts getting to the second Sweet Sixteen <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2021-03-19/history-2-seeds-vs-15-seeds-march-madness">(2nd time in history a 15 seed has ever done this)</a>

                    <p>My model was not significantly better or worse statistically than the average model, however it was slightly worse since ESPN's scoring system
                    puts a large emphasis on picking the champion and I was not able to do so. In addition this year's bracket saw both bigger upsets (Oral Roberts) and more upsets than normal.
