    <h3>March Madness</h3>

<body>
<p>My project is about March Madness and how accurate the model I created was in predicting games</p>
<p>The objectives are:
    <br>1)Was my model more accurate than the average bracket, and if so by how much? Which games were the most shocking to both my model and bracket makers in general?
    <br>2)Who were the perceived favorites and how did they perform?
    <br>3)The user would learn about the effectiveness of my bracket, in addition to randomness and madness that is march madness.
    </p>
<p>So far I have finished one graph (the dot plot) and made rough drafts of 3 different graphs in d3, they are mostly done but I need to work on colors and clean them up. I also made a bar chart race using Flourish.
    <br>By the end of the week all the graphs expect the bar chart race should be finished, and soon after that the bar chart race should be finished
    <br>So far I foresee no future roadblocks</p>

<p>These first 2 graphics are for objective 1</p>
<script src="sketch1.js"></script>
<p>This graph shows the distributions of my bracktes, and where my different brackets end up in terms of overall percentile of the 5+ millions brackets that were made through ESPN
<br>The following graph is a scatter plot that has the percent of times I picked the favorite or better seed to win on the x axis and the y axis is how often all ESPN brackets did</p>
<script src="draw.js"></script>
<p>This next one is for objective 2
<br>And is a small multiples of two different bar charts that show the percent of times I or ESPN choose certain teams to win it all and then how far they went</p>
<script src="sketch2.js"></script>
<p>this next one should be for objective 1 but it is not finished and I'll want it to be a bar chart race, where the different charts are mine, the top one overall and ESPN's "peoples" bracket</p>

<p>This last one is for objective 3 and displays the average seed after each round
<br>The line in red is 2021 which signifies that this year saw more "chaos" due to more upsets than usual</p>
